Evaluating modern QA systems isn’t just about “getting the answer.” It’s about:
	•	Determining semantic correctness — not just surface overlap
	•	Identifying hallucinations and fabricated content
	•	Recognizing partial answers vs. fully complete ones
	•	Scaling judgment beyond manual review to thousands of examples


With over 50K QA pairs generated per day, traditional evaluation methods were insufficient — both in accuracy and scalability.

🧪 What We Set Out to Do
	•	Designed a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining LLM-based reasoning with deterministic metrics
	•	Replaced brittle metrics like BLEU with semantic scoring + logical entailment + LLM judgment
	•	Introduced structured labels:
✅ Fully Correct | 🟡 Partially Correct | 🔴 Hallucinated | 📘 Over-informative
	•	Ran comprehensive evaluation across [INSERT NUMBER] experiments and thousands of examples

⸻

🚀 Impact Delivered
	•	📉 Reduced manual review time by [INSERT HOURS SAVED]
	•	📈 Increased hallucination detection accuracy by [INSERT %]
	•	🧠 Matched human evaluator decisions in over 92% of reviewed cases
	•	Set a new standard for QA evaluation: explainable, trustworthy, and scalable

⸻

🔍 Looking Ahead
	•	Feed judge labels into RLHF reward modeling
	•	Integrate this evaluation pipeline into future QA deployments
	•	Expand from single-answer to multi-reference evaluation
	•	Enable model fine-tuning based on feedback loops from judge outputs
