Method
What It Measures
Tool Used
Sentence Embeddings
Deep contextual similarity
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via SentenceTransformers
TF-IDF Cosine
Lexical co-occurrence across n-grams
Scikit-learn TfidfVectorizer
Word Overlap (Jaccard)
Token-level intersection over union
NLTK tokenization

Embeddings capture meaning but miss rare tokens
	•	TF-IDF highlights shared terms but ignores semantics
	•	Jaccard adds interpretable coverage metric

→ Hybrid approach = more robust detection


Side-by-side or stacked bar chart comparing:
	•	Embedding score
	•	TF-IDF similarity
	•	Jaccard overlap
	•	Final combined score

Maybe with 2 example paragraph pairs:
	•	One consistent
	•	One semantically distant

⸻

🧠 Speaker Notes:
	•	“Semantic similarity doesn’t tell you whether a claim is true — but it tells you whether it’s relevant.”
	•	“We only consider hallucination if the candidate is semantically related to the reference.”
	•	“This layer filters out off-topic but non-harmful outputs

We don’t just check whether facts exist — we check whether they match and occur in the same context.”
	•	“This layer is key to catching subtle numeric hallucinations, which are the most dangerous in domains like finance or medicine.”

Factual matching doesn’t catch semantic opposites
	•	Contradictions occur even if entities/values match

⸻

🧠 Speaker Notes:
	•	“A hallucination can be logically false even when it mentions the same facts.”
	•	“This NLI step captures semantic conflicts, not just mismatches.”
	•	“We use contradiction scores to detect hallucinations like ‘declined’ vs ‘increased’.

We don’t rely on a black-box model.
Instead, we use thresholded signals from 3 modules and apply logical rules.

We prioritize transparency and explainability.”
	•	“This logic lets users trace why a hallucination was flagged.”
	•	“We also calibrate confidence based on multiple factors.”

🧠 Speaker Notes:

	•	“The classifier not only flags issues — it gives actionable insights.”
	•	“This is especially helpful in LLM evaluation pipelines.”



Slide Title: Detection Examples Across Hallucination Types

Reference Paragraph (used for all candidates):

"The company reported revenue of $2.5 million in Q4 2023, with a 15% increase from the previous quarter. CEO John Smith announced expansion plans on January 15, 2024, targeting the Asian market. The profit margin improved to 22% due to cost optimization strategies implemented in September."
